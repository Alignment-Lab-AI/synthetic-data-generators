# Synthetic Data Generators

## Overview

Synthetic Data Generators is a compilation of various scripts developed for generating synthetic data. These scripts have been designed for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, testing, development, and analytics. 

Each script comes with comments at the end, detailing its functionality and providing examples of use. This is to ensure that anyone using these scripts can understand what they do and how they can be used.

## Features

The project consists of multiple data generation scripts. Each script is unique and designed for specific data generation tasks. The scripts generate data in various formats (such as CSV, JSON, XML) and for various use cases.

## Usage

To use a script, simply import it into your project and call the desired function. Be sure to review the comments at the end of each script for an understanding of its use and functionality.
